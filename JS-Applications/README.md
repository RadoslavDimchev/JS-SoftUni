In the "JS Applications" course, you will learn what **HTTP requests** are and how to use them. You will learn about **REST Services**, what a **Baas** (backend as a service) is and how to work with it, what **asynchronous code** means (Promises, using async/await), what **Templating and Routing are**. During the course, you will create a **Single Page Application** using the techniques learned from previous lectures, on which you will be assessed. You will understand what is the **architecture of an application** and how to properly structure your applications. By the end of the course, you'll explore different design patterns and their practical guidelines, create your own web components, use the **Web Components** standard, and build a **Webback environment from scratch**.
