        SEE NO EVIL
      </h2>
      <p>
        I became fascinated with the concept of speak no, see no, hear no evil. And - and the actual depiction
        of
        three wise monkeys. And I began collecting it over the years. And I kind of figured that I might be the
        -
        the fourth monkey, the feel no evil monkey.

        Ideas come from ordinary, everyday life. And from imagination. And from feelings. And from memories.
        Memories of dust in my sneakers and humming whitewalls down a hill called Monkey.

        It is not so important to be serious as it is to be serious about the important things. The monkey
        wears an
        expression of seriousness which would do credit to any college student, but the monkey is serious
        because he
        itches.
